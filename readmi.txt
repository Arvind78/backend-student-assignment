Certainly! Below is an example `README.txt` file content for your backend assignment:

```
# Canvas Backend Assignment README

This repository contains the backend implementation for managing student data using Node.js and Express.

## Instructions

### 1. Running the Application

To start the backend server, follow these steps:

1. Extract the ZIP folder.
2. Open any editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, etc.).
3. Open the terminal.
4. Run the following commands:

```bash
npm install
node index.js
```

This will start the server on `http://localhost:8080`.

### 2. Endpoints

#### Student Details

1. **Create Student**: Send a POST request to `/` endpoint using Postman to add a new student. Include student details such as ID (unique), name, and GPA in the request body.

2. **Retrieve All Students**: Use a browser to send a GET request to `/allStudent` endpoint to fetch all student data.

3. **Retrieve Specific Student**: Access a specific student's details by sending a GET request to `/student/:id` endpoint, replacing `:id` with the student's ID.

4. **Retrieve Topper Student**: Fetch the student with the highest GPA by sending a GET request to `/topper` endpoint.

#### API Endpoints:

- `/allStudent`: Retrieve all student data.
- `/student/:id`: Get specific student details by ID.
- `/topper`: Retrieve the student with the highest GPA.

### Usage

After starting the server, navigate to the following URLs in your browser:

1. [http://localhost:8080/allStudent](http://localhost:8080/allStudent) - Retrieve all student details.
2. [http://localhost:8080/student/104](http://localhost:8080/student/104) - Get details of the student with ID 104.
3. [http://localhost:8080/topper](http://localhost:8080/topper) - Fetch the student with the highest GPA.

```

This README file includes instructions for setting up and running the backend application, along with details about the available endpoints for creating, retrieving, and fetching student data using Postman or a browser. Adjust the endpoint details as needed based on your specific implementation.
